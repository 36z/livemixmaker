This distribution uses an 'overlay filesystem' (currently aufs) to ease
the burden on your likely lifetime-write-limited (e.g. flash) drive.
On boot, a RAM-based tmpfs filesystem is laid over the root filesystem,
equally over a separate /home partition, if it has LABEL='live-home'.
Any future writes to files on the root filesystem go through the overlay.
At the first write of any file, the file is 'copied up' into tmpfs
filesystem and there modified.  Any future reads of so-modified files
happen on the overlay filesystem (e.g. only the new, modified version
is served). Any future reads of non-modified files happen on the lower
filesystem.  At shutdown (and perhaps even while running), the contents of
the upper, overlay filesystem are synchronized onto the lower filesystem.

For more confusing information, please read aufs(5) man page.
