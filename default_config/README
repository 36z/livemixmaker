 File & directory format
===========================================================================

This is livemixmaker config directory. In order to serve its function,
this directory must include, at a minimum:
  * a build.conf file (find example attached), and
  * several directories with names matching regex format:

      [0-9]+\.(confighooks|chroot|packages|package-lists|hooks)

These directories are processed in sort-order (indicated by the numbers
before the dot), while the suffix of each marks the action that will
take place, as described below. The directories that start with 0 are
processed below any parents (see below), and directories with names
starting with 1-9 after.  You can customize the order of these actions
to your needs. Empty and non-conforming directories are skipped.


*.confighooks    Executable files in this directory execute inside this (./)
                 config directory, not in chroot. They can be used for:
                   * automating NFS mounts,
                   * downloading of the latest *.deb packages,
                   * any kind of reconfiguration of distribution config.
                 On successful run (exit 0), confighooks are chmodded -x.
                 If a hook file includes the following line somewhere in
                 its body:

                  # Provides: path_to_file

                 then path_to_file is assumed to be relative path inside
                 this (./) config directory. For example, a confighook
                 that downloads the latest *.deb of Skype from Microsoft
                 could contain a line:

                  # Provides: packages/skype-*.deb

                 When livemixmaker is run with 'cleanall' argument, all
                 confighooks are chmodded back +x and any provided
                 path_to_file files inside the config directory are deleted.


*.chroot    Is a direct view of the root filesystem. Anything you put in
            this directory will be copied over into resulting image
            filesystem(s).


*.packages    All *.deb packages in these directories are installed on
              the target system. You can populate this directory, for
              example, by means of confighooks.


*.package-lists   Holds *.list files that are \n-separated package names
                  to install, optionally prefixed with '-' to have them
                  removed (or not installed).
                  If a line in any of the *.list files starts with '!',
                  then it is executed as a command line and interpreted
                  as its output. (Similar to Live-Systems behavior.)


*.hooks   The executable files in this directory are executed inside
          chroot. Strongly consider maintaining all your —hook and
          otherwise— scripts re-entrant, meaning that their execution
          converges, preferrably with the first run, even if executed
          multiple times.

This is one example livemixmaker-compatible directory that builds 'myOS':
  myOS/README
  myOS/config/build.conf
  myOS/config/1.package-lists/packages.list
  myOS/config/2.chroot/home/user/About_myOS.PDF
  myOS/config/3.hooks/modify_package_X


===========================================================================
 'Parent' distributions
===========================================================================

Any livemixmade distribution can be derived from one or several parents
specified in ./build.conf file. When parents are specified, any 0.*
directories (of above) are processed before any parents. This way
you can even dynamically set parents if you wish, e.g. with a script in
0.confighooks directory. Directories [1-9].* are processed after parents
are built. Intermediate completed stages are cached per best effort.


===========================================================================
 livemixmaker usage
===========================================================================

Run livemixmaker in the parent directory (../) where 'config' directory is
present. For example:
  $ cd my-distro-project
  $ ls                            # note the config directory present
  config  about_my_distro.txt
  $ sudo livemixmaker             # you run livemixmaker here
  ...

If you know it by heart, this file (./README) can be safely deleted,
or populated with more appropriate content.

Please read livemixmaker's --help for more information regarding its use.
